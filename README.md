## 📖 How It Works

### Particle System
1. **Creation**:
   - Particles are generated based on the current generation rate and user settings.
   - Each particle is assigned a size, shape, and color according to the controls.

2. **Behavior**:
   - Particles follow an expanding spiral motion, gradually shrinking until they disappear.
   - Color transitions add a dynamic visual effect, evolving over time.

### Interactive Controls
- The control panel lets you adjust various parameters in real-time, providing a hands-on creative experience.
- Sliders for each setting allow precise adjustments to shape, motion, and appearance.
